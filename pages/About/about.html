    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
         I am <strong> Okoinya Roseline Ezinne,</strong> i live with my family in portharcourt city,
     i have 4 siblings, a lovely sister and 3 wonderful brothers. i am the 4th child of my parents.I am a graduate of MOUAU,
     i love to workout, play volleyball and read law novels.I am a student of capacitybay. okoinya Roseline Ezinne is also a writer with one 
     of her books in Amazon kindle as a best seller under a pen name and is also a fitness therapist. <br>
     Speaking more deeply about oneself is always difficult, Knowing that I possess a variety of qualities,both positive and negative, I now view my sense of self-worth in terms that are somewhat realistic.
     My tendency to protect those I consider to be close and caring attitude are two of the positive traits I possess. I am very proud of my open and honest communication style, which I later learned to better control in order to avoid being offensive. Several times,<ins> I've seen how this honesty helped people gain a better understanding of their own problems and move closer to finding solutions.</ins>
     As we are characterized by our qualities/convictions, it is worth focusing on that the person characteristics I view as most beneficial in an individual are: honesty, conscientiousness, dependability, trustworthiness, responsibility, and respect Making positive, even if insignificant, changes that would enhance the quality of life in my community and ensuring the well-being of the people I care about are the main things that give my life meaning.
     <b>I perceive the propensity for outside control just like a main quality of my character.</b> This sometimes backfires, especially when I get too involved in other people's lives. I found as a young person that I can control, lead, and force my view on my kin and friends. As I was beginning to realize my role as a protector, I initially exercised control over my siblings. Later, 
     it took the form of genuine care and <del>responsibility</del> for their lives and slowly became parenting behavior. These days, I might want to believe that my direction and backing are valuable to individuals I know.
     <i> The desire to be appreciated for my conscientious attitude, discipline, and competence gives my professional life meaning.</i> My ability to lead and make decisions, as well as my seriousness and deep involvement, could be very helpful when organizing small groups of people. However, rather than making deep connections with people in order to motivate them,
     I probably do better at leading by example and providing direct assistance or guidance.
     Who I am is defined by each of the mentioned beliefs, values, and (good or bad) characteristics. They address all I have experienced, saw, and experienced consistently and how I responded to this as a developing/creating person. All that I could expect is to genuinely take advantage of the multitude of positive perspectives while controlling the negative ones.
